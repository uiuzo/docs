2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.  
3. Place the extracted folder inside your `resources` directory on your FiveM server.  
4. Open your `server.cfg` and add the following line at the end to make sure the script starts correctly on server boot:

   ```cfg

   ```

5. Save the `server.cfg` file.  
6. Restart your server or run the following commands in your server console to load the script without restarting:
